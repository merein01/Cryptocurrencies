# Cryptocurrencies
# Overview
For this project, we used unsupervised machine learning to analyze cryptocurrencies 
and create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market classified by group. To perform this analysis, we preprocessed the data, used Principal Component Analysis to reduce the data dimension, used K-Means to cluster cryptocurrencies, and visualized the results eith 2D and 3D scatter plots.

# Summary 
There are a total of 532 tradable cryptocurrencies. The k value is equal to 4 which results in 4 clusters to categorize. The 3D scatter plot reduced the principal components to 3. The 2D scatter plot reduced this to 2. All in all, unsupervised machine learning could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.
